    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. Basics C++ file ends up with .cpp We always need to build the project first before running it. Build will translate your code to the language that the computer can understand MAKE SURE TO PUT ; EVERY TIME YOU FINISH A LINE IN C++. 2. Drawing a shape 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main() &#123; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; You need #include &lt;iostream&gt; and using namespace std at the beginning of your code. Don’t worry their meanings for now, will explain later. int main() is a function in c++, like a container so we can put our codes inside. Codes within the {} will be executed when we run the program. return 0; don’t worry too much for now, remember we need it inside the bracket. cout stands for console out. This will print out the string in the console. endl means ending a line in console. c++ will read code from top to bottom Here I am drawing out a triangle: 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main() &#123; cout &lt;&lt; " /|" &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; " / | " &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; " / |" &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; "/___|" &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; 3. Variable Variable is basically a container where we can store information To create a variable, we need to tell c++ the data type. Let me create a string variable as example: 1string student_name = "John"; We can also create a integer type variable in another format as followed: 12int student_age;student_age = 35; These two formats are equivalent. 1int age,gpa; We may also create multiple variables of the same data type in one line as above. 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main() &#123; string student_name = "John"; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, my name is "&lt;&lt; student_name &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; We can insert a string variable at the end of another string by putting the variable after &lt;&lt;. This operation is like print(f&quot;Hello, my name is{student_name}&quot;) is Python. If we want to insert the variable in the middle of another string, we can use the trick below: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main() &#123; int student_age = 19; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, I am "&lt;&lt;student_age&lt;&lt;" years old"&lt;&lt; endl; return 0; &#125; Make sure to put the variable in between &lt;&lt;. These &lt;&lt; are linking strings and variables together. We can also print two variables in a raw, see the example below: 12345678910111213#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int student_age; student_age = 19; bool isMale; isMale = 0; cout &lt;&lt;student_age&lt;&lt;isMale&lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; It works kinda the same, we use &lt;&lt; link up variables. 4. Data types char grade = &#39;A&#39;; stands for character, it can only store one character. Be careful, we must put the character in between &#39;&#39; rather than &quot;&quot;. string phase = &quot;Hello there&quot;; stands for a string of characters. int age = 50; stands for a whole number. It can be either positive or negative float value = 13.5; can store decimal values. double value = 3.1415; can store decimal values. The difference between double and float is: float can take more decimal points. As a beginner, stick with double bool isMale = false This stands for Boolean values, can either be true or false. 5. Working with strings endl: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World! " ; cout &lt;&lt; "Whats up." &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; endl basically tells c++ to start a new line in the console after each cout operation. If we don’t want to move to a new line, we can remove &lt;&lt; endl. Similar to Python, \n means starting a new line so cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; is equivalent to cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world \n&quot;; string functions: .length() 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string trial; trial = "Hello world"; cout &lt;&lt; trial.length() &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; This will print out the length of a string variable. Be aware, we need to define the variable first. If we do cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world&quot;.length() &lt;&lt; endl, an error will show up. Indexing: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string trial; trial = "Hello world"; cout &lt;&lt; trial[0] &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world"[0] &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; Similar to Python, we can access a certain character in the string by indexing and we don’t have to define a string variable first like what we do for .length(). Assigning a new character: We can modify a character in the string by assigning a new character to it. trial[1] = &#39;E&#39; Now, we have &quot;HEllo world&quot; instead of &quot;Hello world&quot;. .find(): 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string trial; trial = "Hello world"; cout &lt;&lt; trial.find("world",0) &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; We can pass in two parameters, the first will be the substring we wish to find and the second will be where do we want c++ to start searching. By default, the second parameter will be 0. If that substring can’t be find. C++ will return 4294967295. It is a bit odd but this value is actually the largest 32 bits unsigned value, which kind of make sense. .substr(): 1234567891011#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string trial; trial = "Hello world"; string trial_1; trial_1 = trial.substr(2,3); cout &lt;&lt; trial_1 &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; This function will help us cut a substring out of the main string. It requires two parameters, the first parameter will tell c++ where to start cutting. The second parameter will tell c++ how many characters do we need. trial_1 = trial.substr(2,3); Here, we start from the 2 position which is &quot;l&quot; and we need 3 characters. We get llo as expected. 6. Working with numbers A quick demo of the math operations 123456789101112#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; 5 + 7; cout &lt;&lt; 5 - 7; cout &lt;&lt; 15.0 / 7; cout &lt;&lt; 5 * 7; cout &lt;&lt; 10 % 3; return 0;&#125; Here is one thing interesting, if we do cout &lt;&lt; 15/7; C++ will return 2 as we are dividing an int by an int so the result is also an int. How can we fix this, use 15.0 or 7.0 instead. 12345678910111213141516#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; double value; value = 1; cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl; value++; cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl; value--; cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl; value +=3; cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; Here value++ means an increment of 1 to a numerical variable. A short hand in c++. Here value-- means decreasing a numerical variable by 1. A short hand in c++. += -= etc works the same as Python If we do int+int, we get int. That is kinda the reason why int/int will give int as well. Math function: #include &lt;cmath&gt; We need to import these functions before using them. 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;#include &lt;cmath&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; pow(2,3); return 0;&#125; This pow(A,B) function has two parameters, will return A to the power of B. 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;#include &lt;cmath&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; sqrt(4); return 0;&#125; This sqrt(A) takes one parameter, will return the square root of A. 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;#include &lt;cmath&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; round(4.3); return 0;&#125; This round(A) function will follow the normal rounding rule(四舍五入). We also have ceil(A) function, which will round up(向上取整). Oppositely, we have floor(A) function, which will round down(向下取整) 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;#include &lt;cmath&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; cout &lt;&lt; fmax(3,10); return 0;&#125; fmax(A,B) function will take two parameters, return the greater value between A and B. fmin(A,B) function will do the opposite. 7. Getting input from the user Most data types: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int age; cout &lt;&lt;"Please enter your age"; cin &gt;&gt; age; cout &lt;&lt; "You are "&lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old"&lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; Create a variable first as we want input from the user and we need to store it somewhere. Getting an input is kinda the opposite of cout &lt;&lt;. We use cin &gt;&gt; and put the variable name after the &gt;&gt; sign. This method works for most data types except for string. string type: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string name; cout &lt;&lt;"Please enter your name"; getline(cin,name); cout &lt;&lt; "You are "&lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "."&lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; We need to use the getline() function when input is the string type. It takes two parameters which are cin and variable_name. 8. Building a calculatorOur target is to get two input figures from the user and add them together and print out the result. 123456789101112#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int num1, num2; cout &lt;&lt;"Please fill in the first number: "; cin &gt;&gt; num1; cout &lt;&lt;"Please fill in the second number: "; cin &gt;&gt; num2; cout &lt;&lt; "The result is: " &lt;&lt; num1+num2 &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; 9. Building a Mad Libs Game(疯狂填词 wth???)Basically, let the user to input three words and put these words into three sentences. Funny? Maybe. 12345678910111213141516#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; string color,plural_none,celebrity; cout &lt;&lt; "Please fill in a colour." &lt;&lt; endl; getline(cin,color); cout &lt;&lt; "Please fill in a plural none." &lt;&lt; endl; getline(cin,plural_none); cout &lt;&lt; "Please fill in a celebrity." &lt;&lt; endl; getline(cin,celebrity); cout &lt;&lt; "Roses are " &lt;&lt; color &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; plural_none &lt;&lt; " are blue" &lt;&lt; endl; cout &lt;&lt; "I love " &lt;&lt; celebrity &lt;&lt; endl; return 0;&#125; 10. Arrays A variable can only store one value while an array can hold multiple data values. Array operations: 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int lucky_nums[20] = &#123;4,8,12,15,23,42&#125;; cout&lt;&lt;lucky_nums[3]&lt;&lt;endl; lucky_nums[1] = 50; cout&lt;&lt;lucky_nums[1]&lt;&lt;endl;&#125; It is similar to creating a variable but we need to put a [] after the array name and put its elements inside {}. We can limit the length(size) of the array by putting a value inside [](optional). We can obtain an element inside the array by indexing, standard stuff. We can modify an element’s value by assigning a new value to it. If we want to cout the whole array, we need to use for loop 11. Function A container to put codes so we can re-use them in the future main() is actually a function. Create a basic function: 1234567891011#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;void say_hi()&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hello user"&lt;&lt;endl;&#125;int main()&#123; say_hi();&#125; We need to define a function’s return type at the start of defining a function. Everything inside {} are codes of the function. void basically means return nothing. Don’t forget to call the function inside the main(). Create a function with parameters 1234567891011#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;void say_hi(string name)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;name&lt;&lt;endl;&#125;int main()&#123; string student = "Oscar"; say_hi(student);&#125; It is kinda similar to Python I guess but we must specify the data type of the formal parameter(形参) we want to input. In terms of the example above, say_hi(string name). 123456789101112#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;void say_hi(string name, int age)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;name&lt;&lt;". You are "&lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old" &lt;&lt; endl;&#125;int main()&#123; string student = "Oscar"; int student_age = 19; say_hi(student,student_age);&#125; We may pass in multiple parameters if we wish. MAKE SURE TO SPECIFY THE DATA TYPE. Order is important in c++, make sure to define the function before calling it in main. If we really want to reverse the order, see the example below, there is a trick we can do. 123456789101112131415#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;void say_hi(string name, int age);int main()&#123; string student = "Oscar"; int student_age = 19; say_hi(student,student_age);&#125;void say_hi(string name, int age)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;name&lt;&lt;". You are "&lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; " years old" &lt;&lt; endl;&#125; We can declare a function first by void say_hi(string name, int age); and fill in codes later. We may pass parameters into a function, but we are actually passing in their values instead of variables themselves. If we want to modify values of variables, WE MUST PASS IN POINTERS AND DEFERENCE THEM. 12. Return statement We must specify the return data type when defining a function. We can set any one of the data types we know as return. If we don’t want anything to return, use void Define a function with return: 123456789101112131415#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;double cube(double figure)&#123; double result; result = figure*figure*figure; return result;&#125;int main()&#123; double value = 3.14; cout&lt;&lt;cube(value)&lt;&lt;endl;&#125; return is very similar to Python. The function will be terminated when return is executed. Don’t forget to put a ; after the return statement. 13. If statement Allow our program to respond to different conditions。 if(condition){operation} In other words, if the condition in () is true, codes within {} will run. See the example, below 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; bool is_male = false; if(is_male)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hey, this is a boy"&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125; We can also do logic operators inside (). We have &amp;&amp; for and operator. || for or operator. Example:if(is_male &amp;&amp; is_tall){cout&lt;&lt;&quot;You are both tall and male&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;} The basic logic structure in C++ is similar to Python. 12345678910111213141516#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; if()&#123; &#125; else if()&#123; &#125; else&#123; &#125;&#125; We can also do if, else and else if The negation operator in C++ is !. Basically, if we have is_tall = true, !is_tall will be false. This basically reverses the answer. 14. More if statement(comparison operators) A quick example, see below 1234567891011121314151617181920#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; double num1,num2; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the first number"&lt;&lt; endl; cin&gt;&gt; num1; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the second number"&lt;&lt; endl; cin&gt;&gt; num2; if(num1&gt;num2)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"The first number is greater which is "&lt;&lt;num1&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else if(num1&lt;num2)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"The second number is greater which is "&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else if(num1==num2)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Two numbers are equal, they are both "&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125; We have a number of comparison operators: &gt;, &lt;, ==, !=. We can mix these comparison operators with logic operators(&amp;&amp;, ||). 15. Build a more powerful calculatorThe user can fill in two numbers as well as the operator. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; char operat; double num1,num2,result; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the first number"&lt;&lt;endl; cin&gt;&gt;num1; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the operator"&lt;&lt;endl; cin&gt;&gt;operat; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the second number"&lt;&lt;endl; cin&gt;&gt;num2; if (operat == '+')&#123; result = num1+num2; cout&lt;&lt;num1&lt;&lt;operat&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;"="&lt;&lt;result&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else if(operat == '-')&#123; result = num1-num2; cout&lt;&lt;num1&lt;&lt;operat&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;"="&lt;&lt;result&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else if(operat == '*')&#123; result = num1*num2; cout&lt;&lt;num1&lt;&lt;operat&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;"="&lt;&lt;result&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else if(operat == '/')&#123; result = num1/num2; cout&lt;&lt;num1&lt;&lt;operat&lt;&lt;num2&lt;&lt;"="&lt;&lt;result&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; else&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Invalid operator input"&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125; 16. Switch statements switch statement is a special type of if statement. See the example below. In this example, we want to convert 0 to Sunday, 1 to Monday and 2 to Tuesday etc. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;string convert(int choice)&#123; string day_result; switch (choice) &#123; case 0: day_result = "Sunday"; break; case 1: day_result = "Monday"; break; case 2: day_result = "Tuesday"; break; case 3: day_result = "Wednesday"; break; case 4: day_result = "Thursday"; break; case 5: day_result = "Friday"; break; case 6: day_result = "Saturday"; break; default: day_result = "Invalid input"; break;&#125; return day_result;&#125;int main()&#123; int figure; cout&lt;&lt;"Please fill in the number you wish to convert."&lt;&lt;endl; cin&gt;&gt;figure; cout&lt;&lt;convert(figure)&lt;&lt;endl;&#125; switch statement is very useful when we want to compare several values with a variable. In the case above, we could compare 1, 2, 3…. to choice variable but it is inefficient. We may write a switch (choice) and case 0: which will be equivalent to choice == 0. We need to put a break in each case. Otherwise, if choice == 3, it will enter case 3 and keep going into case4, case5, case6 and default unless there is a break in any case. We put a break in case 3 so it won’t go into the following cases. 17. While loops Basic structure: while(condition){codes} Quick demo: 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main() int index; index = 0; while(index&lt;5)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;index&lt;&lt;endl; index ++; &#125;&#125; We get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as expected. There is also a loop called do while loop, see the example below 12345678910#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main() int index; index = 6; do&#123; cout&lt;&lt;index&lt;&lt;endl; index ++; &#125;while(index&lt;5)&#125; We get 6 as the answer. Let me explain, it is like the reverse of a while loop. We will run the codes insidedo{} first before checking where while() is met. If while is met, it will keep going. If not, it will terminate. That is kinda why we still get 6 even though index is already greater than 5. 18. Guessing game12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int result_figure,choice; result_figure = 5; int chance,max_chance; max_chance = 5; chance = 0; while(true)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Please guess a number"&lt;&lt;endl; cin&gt;&gt;choice; if(choice == result_figure)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Congrats, you win"&lt;&lt;endl; break; &#125; else&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"You are wrong"&lt;&lt;endl; chance ++; &#125; if(chance == max_chance)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"You ran out of chance, lost"&lt;&lt;endl; break; &#125; &#125;&#125; Nothin too exciting :-( 19. For loops 12345678#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main()&#123; for(int i=1;i&lt;=5;i++)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; return 0; &#125; The for loop in c++ is a bit different from python. We must pass in three parameters, the first parameter is to define a i or index. The second is to set the condition which will terminate the loop and finally what should be done to i every time we go through one circulation of the loop. We separate these parameters using; . There is another way to write the above codes, see below. 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; for(int i=1;i&lt;=5;)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;endl; i++; &#125; return 0;&#125; One useful thing is to print out elements in an array. See below 123456789#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int list_of_nums[] = &#123;0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10&#125;; for (int i=0;i&lt;=11;i++)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;list_of_nums[i]&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; return 0;&#125; This basically print out every element in the list_of_nums array. 20. Exponent function123456789101112131415#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int result,base,power; base =3; power =3; result =1; for(int i=0;i&lt;power;i++)&#123; result*=base; &#125; cout&lt;&lt;result&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; Only consider positive power factor to simplify. 21. 2d arrays &amp; nested loops 2d arrays: every element in an array is an array like [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] in Python. Create a 2d array: 123456#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int number_grid[3][2]=&#123;&#123;1,2&#125;,&#123;4,5&#125;,&#123;7,8&#125;&#125;; return 0;&#125; When creating a 2d array, we need two []. The first [] is to define how many arrays do we have in the outside array. The second is two define how many elements do we have in each inside array. We can access any element in a 2d array using cout&lt;&lt;number_grid[row][column] Nested loop is superposing for loops. In other words, a for loop in a for loop. We can use this technique to return every element in thenumber_grid array. See below. 1234567891011#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int number_grid[3][2]=&#123;&#123;1,2&#125;,&#123;4,5&#125;,&#123;7,8&#125;&#125;; for(int i = 0; i&lt;3; i++)&#123; for(int j = 0;j&lt;2;j++)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;number_grid[i][j]&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; &#125; return 0;&#125; Basically, putting the other for loop inside the {} of the first for loop. 22. Comments We can use // to create one line of comments. We can use /* to start multiple lines of comments and */ to terminate. 23. Pointers(指针) A variable is physically stored at a specific address inside the RAM so the computer can keep track. If we want to print out the memory address of a variable, put &amp; before the variable name. 1234567#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int num1 = 12; cout&lt;&lt; &amp;num1&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; We get 0x6dfefc in this case, it is an address in hexadecimal. In c++, we won’t use the phrase memory address, instead, we call it pointer. We can create a variable to store pointer. See the example below. 1234567#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main()&#123; int num1 = 12; int* pNum1 = &amp;num1; return 0;&#125; When creating a pointer variable, we put *p on top of the original variable name. Also, the data type of the pointer variable is the same as the original variable data type. Let me explain, &amp;num1 is an address so do pNum1 while * means dereferencing, *pNum1 is actually the value at that pointer address, which is int. We can also dereference a pointer to find the actual value which is stored at that address. cout&lt;&lt;pNum1&lt;&lt;endl; will print out the pointer address, we get 0x6dfef8. cout&lt;&lt;*pNum1&lt;&lt;endl; will dereference and print out the actual value, we get 12. If we do cout&lt;&lt;*&amp;num1&lt;&lt;endl;, we get 12 as expected. If we do cout&lt;&lt;&amp;*&amp;num1&lt;&lt;endl;, we get 0x6dfef8 as expected. 24. Classes &amp; Objects(OOP) Existing data types in c++ are not enough for us to model everything. We can kinda create a new data type by creating a class. See the example below. 12345678910111213141516171819#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; int price; string cpu; string RAM;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone; my_phone.name = "iphone x"; my_phone.price = 6888; my_phone.cpu = "A10"; my_phone.RAM = "3G"; cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.name&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; The codes above are similar to using __init__ function in Python. class is more like a template, we can specify values of its attributes by creating an object. In the code above, we create an object using Phone my_phone;. 25. Constructor functions A special function which will always be called whenever we create an object. See codes below. 1234567891011121314#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; Phone()&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hey, I am creating a new object"&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone; return 0;&#125; We are creating a function inside public. The function name MUST be the same as the class name. We may pass parameters into the constructor function. See below. 12345678910111213#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; Phone(string phone_name)&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"Hey, I am creating a new object called "&lt;&lt;phone_name&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone("Iphone X"); return 0; We are passing in a phone_name parameter, we must specify its value when creating an object. Also similar to __init__ function Python. However, we still need to manually specify values of attributes. Constructor functions can save us some efforts. See below 12345678910111213141516171819202122#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; int price; string cpu; string RAM; Phone(string Aname,int Aprice,string Acpu,string ARAM)&#123; name = Aname; price = Aprice; cpu = Acpu; RAM = ARAM; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone("Iphone x",6888,"A10","3G"); cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.name&lt;&lt;endl; return 0; One thing I need to point out, when naming parameter names inside the constructor function. It is a good practice to put an A before the actual name. In Python, we do Phone.name = name. In c++, name = name can be very confusing so instead we do name = Aname. Make it crystal clear. We may also create multiple constructor functions. See below. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; int price; string cpu; string RAM; Phone()&#123; name = "No info"; price = 0; cpu = "No info"; RAM = "No info" &#125; Phone(string Aname,int Aprice,string Acpu,string ARAM)&#123; name = Aname; price = Aprice; cpu = Acpu; RAM = ARAM; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone no_info_phone; Phone my_phone("Iphone x",6888,"A10","3G"); cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.name&lt;&lt;endl; cout&lt;&lt;no_info_phone.name&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; This is an excellent way of setting attributes some default values. 26. Object functions Functions we can put inside a class. See below. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;public: string name; int price; string cpu; string RAM; Phone(string Aname,int Aprice,string Acpu,string ARAM)&#123; name = Aname; price = Aprice; cpu = Acpu; RAM = ARAM; &#125; bool if_expensive()&#123; if(price&gt;2000)&#123; return true; &#125; else&#123; return false; &#125; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone("Iphone x",6888,"A10","3G"); cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.if_expensive()&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; We defined an if_expensive function inside the class. We don’t need to pass in self in c++. We can use parameters directly. To be specific, we use price rather than self.price that is kinda why we don’t need to pass in self as a parameter. 27. Getters &amp; Setters We can use these to control access to attributes. See below. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Phone&#123;private: string name; int price; string cpu; string RAM;public: Phone(string Aname,int Aprice,string Acpu,string ARAM)&#123; name = Aname; price = Aprice; cpu = Acpu; RAM = ARAM; &#125; string name_getter()&#123; return name; &#125; void name_setter(string Aname)&#123; name = Aname; &#125;&#125;;int main()&#123; Phone my_phone("Iphone x",6888,"A10","3G"); cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.name_getter()&lt;&lt;endl; my_phone.name_setter("Iphone 8"); cout&lt;&lt;my_phone.name_getter()&lt;&lt;endl; return 0;&#125; We can put attributes that we don’t want users to access inside private:. These attributes can only be accessed by functions inside class{} but not elsewhere. We may want users to modify certain data so we define a name_setter(). We may want users to access certain data so we define a name_getter(). 28. Inheritance(继承) We can define a new class by extending an existing class. See the example below for a very basic introduction. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;class Student&#123;public: void gaming()&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"I want to do some gaming"&lt;&lt;endl; &#125; void study()&#123; cout&lt;&lt;"I want to spend some time studying"&lt;&lt;endl; &#125;&#125;;class Yuxuan :public Student&#123;&#125;;int main()&#123; Yuxuan me; me.study(); return 0;&#125; We can inherit public functions, attributes from a superclass into a subclass. These functions can also be overwritten simply by defining it again. EndThanks for reading. These notes are abstract from the c++ tutorial created by Mike Dane(Giraffe academy).

    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F09%2Fhtml_basics%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[HTML files end up with .html 1. TagsDOCTYPE1&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; The tag as shown above will tell the internet explorer that we are writing an html file. For this tag, we don’t need an ending tag and for other tags(container tags) we need an ending tag for each starting tag. html123&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Here are html tags with a starting tag and an ending tag. / is used to denote that it is an ending tag. This is the highest level tag in our website, other contents are under these tags. head123&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; Another type of tags are head tags. We can define the title, description of the document and also other information related to the document. It is like the settings of the html file. body123&lt;body&gt; Hello world&lt;/body&gt; The body tags are like the meat and bone of the web page. This is the main part of the website. Normally way longer than the head tags. We can simply put a Hello World inside the body tag and Chrome will print it out for us. Indent12345678&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Pay extra attention to the indents. head tags and body tags are both inside the html tags. &lt;html&gt; is like the parents while &lt;head&gt;&amp;&lt;body&gt; are like children ish. &lt;head&gt; and&lt;body&gt; are sort of siblings as they both have one tab indent. Title123&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;The title of the website&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt; Inside head tags, we can put an extra tag called title tags. We fill the title of the web page in the tags. 2. More basic tags in detailMeta12345&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;The title of the website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; &lt;meta name = "description" content = "This is the description"&gt; &lt;/head&gt; This tag will give us some meta data, we can put the type of character encoding inside as above. Also, we can put a description inside the meta tag. So when people search our website on Google, this description will be used for reference. meta tags will be introduced in detail in later sections. Heading12345678&lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt; The fist header &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; THe second header &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can create a header using the code above, &lt;h1&gt; will give us the largest font size of the header while &lt;h6&gt; will give us the smallest font size available for a header. Paragraph12345&lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; Put the contents of the paragraph inside &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can create a paragraph using &lt;p&gt;. All paragraphs will format itself automatically. The order of paragraphs in the html file is simply the order shown on the webpage. Bold(加粗)1&lt;b&gt;The contents you want to bold&lt;/b&gt; Whenever you want to bold certain contents, simply put it inside &lt;b&gt;. Italic(斜体)1&lt;i&gt;The contents you want to make it italic&lt;/i&gt; Whenever you want to make certain contents italic, simply put it inside &lt;i&gt;. Moreover, we can superpose&lt;p&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&amp;&lt;b&gt;. To make a paragraph both bold and italic. Whitespace1234567891011&lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first paragraph &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The second paragraph &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt; 12345678&lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first paragraph &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The second paragraph &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt; html doesn’t read the whitespace between the codes. It only cares about what is in the tags. In other words, the codes above are technically the same. Break123&lt;body&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/body&gt; If we want a blank line on our web page. We could use the tag &lt;br/&gt; and html will read it. You can make multiple tags to create multiple blank lines. Horizontal line123&lt;body&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can create a horizontal line like this. We may want to use it on our web page to break up contents. Big tag12345&lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;big&gt;first&lt;/big&gt; paragraph &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt; If we want to make certain contents greater in font size, using &lt;big&gt; tags is one of the easiest way. Simply put the contents between &lt;big&gt; and &lt;/big&gt;. It is not that significant but will work. Things works exactly the same for &lt;small&gt;and &lt;/small&gt;. Subscript(下标)&amp;superscript(上标)123&lt;p&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/p&gt; If we want to write the chemical formula for water. We need a subscript 2. It can be easily achieved in html by putting 2 between &lt;sub&gt;&amp;&lt;/sub&gt;. 123&lt;p&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; If we want to write 10 square in html. We need a superscript 2. Simply do the very similar thing with &lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;. SummaryThis tags not only works in &lt;body&gt;. It works in all parts of the html file where there is a text. 3. Comments12&lt;!-- Put your comments inside --&gt; Everything within &lt;!-- --&gt;is comments and it may take up multiple lines. Very similar to other programming languages, it’s like a little note and can be ignored. 4. Style and colorsThis is a very basic introduction of CSS(Cascading style sheets) which is used for styling. There is a separate course just for CSS 123456&lt;body&gt; &lt;p style = "color: blue"&gt; The fist paragraph &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; We can pass some attributes to &lt;p&gt; tags. Here, we are passing a style attribute and set the text color to blue. 123456&lt;body&gt; &lt;p style = "color: blue;backgroung-color: red"&gt; The fist paragraph &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; We can also set the background color to red using the code above. These attributes also work for other tags like &lt;h1&gt;, even&lt;body&gt; tags work. 5. Formatting the websiteHeader12345678910111213&lt;body&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;main&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;/article&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/body&gt; Most web pages will have three sections which are headers(页眉), main and footer(页脚). Html has various tags for creating these sections as shown in the code above. Some extra things, using &lt;nav&gt; tags we could create a navigation table and it’s normally in the &lt;header&gt; part of the webpage We can also create an article(like the ones in a blog) using &lt;article&gt; tags and they are normally in the &lt;main&gt; part of the webpage. Section12345678&lt;main&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/main&gt; &lt;section&gt; tags often come with &lt;article&gt; tags as they make the web page well-structured. Of course, an &lt;article&gt; can contain multiple &lt;section&gt;. Aside1234&lt;body&gt; &lt;aside&gt; &lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/body&gt; You can put something that is not directly related to the core contents in the &lt;aside&gt; tags. A good example is advertisements on web pages. SummaryTo be honest, all those tags are not necessary, you may create a fabulous website without these structural tags but they can make your website extremely organized and improve the readability of your code. Also, this kind of neat structure allows search engines to figure out what is inside easily. 6. Links(超链接)Links are used in html to link your website to other websites, other parts of your website or jpg, pdf etc. 123&lt;body&gt; &lt;a href = "https://www.google.com"&gt;Text shown for this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt; By using &lt;a&gt; tags we can create a link to a different website. Simply, put the website url inside the hrefattribute and put the text you wish to show between &lt;a&gt;&amp;&lt;/a&gt;. Attention, the code above will navigate users to the url directly so they leave your website. 123&lt;body&gt; &lt;a href = "https://google.com" target = "_blank"&gt;Text shown for url&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt; If we want user to open a new web page for this link, we could add an extra attribute target = &quot;_blank&quot; inside &lt;a&gt;tags. 123&lt;body&gt; &lt;a href = "relative local address"&gt;another page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt; If we want to link to a different pages of our website. We can simply set the href attribute equal to the relative local address(It must be the relative address, the absolute address won’t work) of our html file. This can automatically navigate to this file. 123&lt;body&gt; &lt;a href = "address of picture"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt; If we want to link to a picture in your computer, it works the same, simply put the relative address of the picture inside the href attribute. 7.ImagesBasics123&lt;body&gt; &lt;img src="url of the image" alt = "text to show if the in scr image is not available" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; scr attribute stores the source of the picture. &lt;alt&gt; attribute is more like a backup, it is some text that will be shown when the picture in scr is no longer available. It is always a good practice to write a &lt;alt&gt;. Besides, we don’t need an end tag for &lt;img simply do /&gt; when you finish. Very similar to links, we can do relative address of the picture instead of the url. 1&lt;img width = "100" height = "50" src="url of the image" alt = "text" /&gt; We could alter dimensions of the image by passing in width &amp;heightattributes. The unit we use here are pixels(像素). 1&lt;img width = "100" src="url of the image" alt = "text" /&gt; Instead of setting both height of width, we could set only one attribute of those. HTML will set the other value automatically to keep the aspect ratio(长宽比) unchanged. Example: Set an image as a link12345&lt;body&gt; &lt;a href = "https://www.google.com"&gt; &lt;img width = "100" src="url of the image" alt = "text" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt; The code above is an example of setting an image also as a link. This trick also works for other tags like&lt;h1&gt; etc. 8. Videos &amp; YouTubeBasics123&lt;body&gt; &lt;video src ="relative address " controls width = "100"&gt;Text shows if video can't play&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can add a video to the website using &lt;video&gt;. Very similar to adding a picture we use a relative address and reserved word controls afterwards(very important, otherwise there will be no buttons for us to control the video ). The text between &lt;video&gt; and &lt;/video&gt;will only be shown if the browser can’t play this video. In addition, we can control dimensions of the video by passing in width and height attributes. Old tricks as we used it in previous sections already. Poster123&lt;body&gt; &lt;video src ="relative address" controls poster = "relative address"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/body&gt; Instead of showing the first scene of the video as the poster, we could DIY our poster. Simply set an extra attribute called poster and pass in the relative address of our poster. Auto play &amp; loop(自动重复播放)123&lt;body&gt; &lt;video src ="relative address" controls loop autoplay&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/body&gt; Simply pass in extra reserved words autoplay and loop. Easy peasy, lemon squeasy! YouTube videos1234&lt;body&gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JnfIa84TnU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/body&gt; Click the share button of the YouTube video and choose Embed. This will give us some&lt;iframe&gt; code. We can use them to add YouTube videos to our website. Don’t worry too much about&lt;iframe&gt; for now. This will also give you the YouTube control panel which is awesome. 9. ListsUnordered list1234567&lt;body&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href = "apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Banana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We could create an unordered list by using the &lt;ul&gt;tags. The &lt;ul&gt; tags act as a container and we can put each list item inside tags &lt;li&gt; . Different types of data can be put inside one unordered list. See the Apple example, we actually put a link inside the list along with some texts. As we are creating an unordered list, each item starts with a black dot. Ordered list1234567&lt;body&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href = "apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Banana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/body&gt; An ordered list actually works almost the same, except we got serial numbers at the start of each item instead of black dots. Style123456&lt;body&gt; &lt;ol type = "a"&gt; &lt;li&gt;apple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;bacon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can change the style of the ordered list. Simply input an extra attribute calledtype. Its value can be &quot;a&quot;so we got a,b,c ….. It may also be &quot;A&quot; so we got A,B,C …… Apart from those, we can have Roman numerals(I,II,III,IV….) by inputting &quot;I&quot; Cascade lists123456789101112&lt;body&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;apple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;banana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;school&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;uni&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We can have lists in a list(cascade). See the example above, we have two unordered lists inside an ordered list. 10. Table123456789101112131415&lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;caption&gt;The title of the table&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title_1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title_2&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title_3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;two&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;three&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/body&gt; We initialize tables in html using &lt;table&gt;tags. &lt;tr&gt; tags are placed inside to act as a row container. For elements in a row, we put every of them inside&lt;td&gt;tags. Here we got three elements in a row. If we want more rows or more elements, simply add more &lt;tr&gt;&amp;&lt;td&gt;. For creating table headers, it works similarly, just use &lt;th&gt; instead of &lt;td&gt;. One more thing, we can create a caption(title) for the table using&lt;caption&gt;tags at the very top. 11. Containers in HTML(div,span)BasicsIt is a good habit to put your HTML code inside containers. One reason is that in the future we will use CSS to formatting your web page. It makes CSS code really easy if your HTML codes are well structured in containers. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are two popular containers. Types of elementsThere are basically two types of elements in HTML. The first type is called the block elements. They will occupy the entire width of the page. The other one is called inline elements. They will only occupy the space they actually need. See the example below. 12&lt;a href="google.com"&gt;link1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href = "apple.com"&gt;link2&lt;/a&gt; Link1 and link2 are clearly inline elements. As neither of them takes up the entire lines, they are actually sitting beside(in the same line with) each other. 123456&lt;p&gt; Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt; Paragraphs here are clearly block elements. There is enough space after paragraph 1 for paragraph 2. However, these two paragraphs don’t sit beside each other. Instead, paragraph 2 switch to a different line. &lt;span&gt;12&lt;span&gt;The fist span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; tags are inline elements. The contents inside are able to sit beside each other. &lt;div&gt;123456&lt;div&gt; The fist div&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; The second div&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; tags are block elements. Either of them occupies their own line. They can’t sit beside each other. Summary&lt;div&gt; is a block element. &lt;span&gt; is a inline element. More popular than&lt;div&gt;. 12. Input tagsText box123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type="text" value = "DPOefault text"/&gt; &lt;/body&gt; We are using a single &lt;input&gt; tag in html. We need to pass in a type attribute. The code above will generate a text box for user to type in. We can set default text for the text box by passing in a value attribute and set it equal to the text we want to show. Password box123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type = "password" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; Here we are creating a text box for password. This text box will automatically hide the user inputs. Textarea123&lt;body&gt; &lt;textarea rows = "10" cols="3"&gt;Default text&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/body&gt; It is simply a bigger block where users can input some text. We can control its dimension by setting rows and cols attributes. Date123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type = "date" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; The will create a box where users can select a certain date. Range123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type = "range" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; This will produce a slider. File123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type = "file" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; This will create a button for user to choose file. The file explorer will shown up if an user click the button. Checkbox123&lt;body&gt; &lt;input type = "checkbox" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; A tiny box, user a click it to tick the box. We could tick as many checkboxes as we want. Radio button12345&lt;body&gt; &lt;input name ="Oscar" type = "radio" /&gt; &lt;input name = "Oscar" type = "radio" /&gt; &lt;input name = "Oscar" type = "radio" /&gt;&lt;/body&gt; Radio buttons are kinda similar to checkbox. The biggest difference is that we can only tick one of the radio buttons with the same name attribute. There are so many types of inputs. I am only listing a number of them, there is a web page for references. Make sure to check it out https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp&gt;. 13. iFrame12345&lt;body&gt; &lt;iframe scr = "www.mikedane.com" width = "1000" height ="800"&gt; The text will be shown if iframe is not working &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt; By using the &lt;iframe&gt; tags, we could display the website in the scr attribute on your website(kinda like enbedded someone else’s website on yours). The default size for&lt;iframe&gt; is tiny, we can change its dimensions by passing in width &amp;height attributes similar to before. One of the biggest problem for iframe is that many big websites(amazon.com etc) have settings preventing other developers to iframe their websites so don’t be too surprised if iframe is not working! 14. Meta tags1234567&lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset = "utf-8"&gt; &lt;meta name = "description" content="Your description"&gt; &lt;meta name = "author" content = "Name of the author"&gt; &lt;meta name = "keywords" content = "HTML, Blog, what not"&gt; &lt;meta name = "viewport" content ="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &lt;meta&gt;tags are in the &lt;head&gt; . They define some key information of your web page. charset defines how your words are encoded. For the other&lt;meta&gt; tags, there are two attributes, the name will tell html what types of meta tags you are defining and content is actually the content inside your meta tags. description gives a short description of your website to help search engines. Normally less than 160 characters. If too long, your website can be disadvantaged in terms of priority in search engine author tells the author of the web page keywords set several keywords to help search engines, are normally ignored these days but still a good practice to fill in. viewport how your website is displayed on different devices like pc, mobile, ipad etc. It can get really complicated, for now just keep in mind using the following statement: content =&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; before you become an experienced developer.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[MySQL notes Database(DB): Any collection of related information that can be stored in different ways. Database management system(DBMS): software used to manage data in the database. C.R.U.D: Create Read Update Delete Relational databases(SQL): organize data onto one or more tables similar to Excel. Non-relational databases(no SQL): Everything but not SQL like JSON,XML etc. SQL(Structured Query Language): standard language interacts with DBMS to perform C.R.U.D operations. Database queries: requests made to the DBMS for specific information, in other words, asks the database for specific pieces of information There is always a primary key to a table, each row has its own primary key. A row may also have a foreign key which leads to a primary key to a different table. This foreign key will help us link with other tables. A certain row may have multiple foreign keys. A foreign key may also lead to a different row in the same table Composite key: a key made up of multiple columns i.e. multiple attributes. We need composite keys because sometimes one column can’t define a primary key without repeating so we need multiple columns as the key. SQL language is the compound of a series of languages as followed: Data Query Language(DQL), Data Definition Language(DDL), Data Control Language(DCL) and Data Manipulation Language(DML) Queries: a set of instructions given to DBMS to obtain the information you want to retrieve. Data type: INT: integer; DECIMAL(M,N): M means the total number of significant digits; N means the number of digits you want to keep after the decimal place; VARCHAR(L): L means the length of the string; BLOB: binary a large object, a structure can store large amount of binary data; DATE: YYYY-MM-DD; TIMESTAMP: YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS normally used to record time People normally write reserved words in SQL in capital letters such as CREATE TABLE Create columns: 123456CREATE TABLE student(student_id INT,name VARCHAR(20),major VARCHAR(20),PRIMARY KEY(student_id)); CREATE TABLE: reserved words student: table name student_id, name, major: column name INT,VARCHAR(): datatype PRIMARY KEY(): reserved words, put the column name inside brackets. Make sure to end the line with ; DESCRIBE student; This command will give some basic information about the table. We can modify the structure of the table after created. DROP TABLE student; Delete the whole table student ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2); Add an extra column ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa; Remove a column from the list name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL When creating a table we may put NOT NULL after the column name so data in this column can’t be NULL. Similarly, we could also put UNIQUE, which means that all data must be unique in that table The primary key must be both NOT NULL and UNIQUE. major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT &#39;undecided&#39; We could set a default value to certain columns We could also set the value to be AUTO_INCREMENT, which may be quite useful for the primary key, simply do student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT. Inserting data: 1INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;Biology&quot;); INSERT: reserved word to put data into the table INTO: reserved word student: table name VALUES(): reserved word, there are three parameters in the bracket. One for each column. We may put NULL in the bracket and it is equivalent to not being filled. SELECT * FROM student This command will print out all data from the table. INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(2,&quot;Kate&quot;); If we only want to fill in data in two columns rather than all three. We could put a bracket after table name and fill in column names that we wish to fill and leaving the unfilled ones NULL. Unless DEFAULT, AUTO_INCREMENT etc. are used. &lt;&gt; means not equal in MySQL. Update data: 123UPDATE studentSET major = &quot;Bio&quot;WHERE major = &quot;Biology&quot;; UPDATE: reserved word for changing data SET: reserved word for setting new data WHERE: reserved word to filter the part of data we want to change Similarly, lines below will set gpa to be 4.0 at the row with student_id = 1 123UPDATE studentSET gpa = 4.0WHERE student_id = 1; For the WHERE command, we can make it more complex by using OR, AND etc statements. We can also change multiple columns in one line using SET. See below. 123UPDATE studentSET gpa = 4.0, name = &apos;Oscar&apos;WHERE student_id = 1; Delete data: 12DELETE FROM studentWHERE name = &quot;Tom&quot; AND major = &quot;undecided&quot; The operation above will delete a certain row according to the WHERE condition. Without WHERE, all rows will be deleted. Basic query: SELECT * FROM student; We already know the query above will give us all the data in the table. SELECT: reserved word, tell SQL we want to get some information from the database. We can get data from certain column(s) by filling its name after SELECT, see below. 1SELECT student_name, student_subject FROM student; The line below is equivalent to the line above, using student.student_id &amp; student.student_subject but make your language more precise. 1SELECT student.student_name,student.student_subject FROM student; We may also order the data obtained simply using reserved word ORDER BY + column name. By default it is ascending, we can make it descending by adding DESC after the column name. 123SELECT student.name, student.majorFROM studentORDER BY name; We could also fill multiple column names after ORDER BY. In the case below, if major is the same, student_id will be used for ranking. 123SELECT *FROM studentORDER BY major, student_id; If we only want a certain number of results, we can add an extra line LIMIT 2 so we will only get the top 2 results in the list. 1234SELECT *FROM studentORDER BY major, student_idLIMIT 2; Filter operation can be done by using WHERE, similar to the operation used in the update data section. In this case, we only print out student information who is doing Biology 123SELECT *FROM studentWHERE major = &quot;Biology&quot;; If we want to add comments in MySQL use -- at the start of the line IN 123SELECT *FROM studentWHERE name IN (&quot;Claire&quot;, &quot;Kate&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;); Another thing you can put after WHERE is IN (reserved word). Very similar to Python, which means return all data in the name column which are in the list of [Claire, Kate, Mike]. You can also connect other statements for filtration using AND, OR etc. Creating a foreign key when creating a table: 12FOREIGN KEY(column_name) REFERENCES table_name(column_name)ON DELETE SET NULL; For the column we REFERENCES to, it must be the primary key. We will always put ON DELETE SET NULL or ON DELETE CASCADE when creating a foreign key, this will make our lives a lot easier and I will explain it a bit later. Add foreign key after a table is created: 1234ALTER TABLE employeeADD FOREIGN KEY(branch_id)REFERENCES branch(branch_id)ON DELETE SET NULL; This is faily commonly used as we can’t reference foreign key to another table before the other table is created first. Don’t forget ON DELETE SET NULL Set a composite primary key: Simply use PRIMARY KEY(column1,column2)when creating a table A primary key may also be A foreign key. VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! If we want to set foreign keys reference to a different form. It is very likely that the second form has not been created. If we still set foreign keys, no wonder there will be an error. What we should do is to set elements in the foreign key column to be NULL. Create the second table first, then UPDATE, SET elements in the foreign key column. It is kinda like a circular procedure. 当我们向有foreign key的表格中插入内容时 要考虑一个问题， 就是这个foreign key指向的表格的内容很可能还没有被输入 这时就会报错 我们要做的就是把这些foreign key 的值先写成NULL 待指向的表格的内容输入后 再进行UPDATE We can temporarily change the returned column names by using AS: 12SELECT fitst_name AS forename, last_name AS surnameFROM employee; Column names are forename &amp; surname now instead of first_name &amp; last_name. If we want to get rid of repeated elements in a column we can use DISTINCT. 1SELECT DISTINCT branch_id FROM employee; Internal functions: 12SELECT COUNT(emp_id)FROM employee; This COUNT function will count how many elements appeared in the emp_id column and return an INT value. If one of the element is NULL, it won’t be counted as it stands for no value. 123SELECT COUNT(emp_id)FROM employeeWHERE sex = &quot;F&quot; AND birth_date &gt; &apos;1970-01-01&apos;; Various operations can be achieved using COUNT in together with WHERE. The example above can help us find how many female employees are born after 1970-1-1. Be careful, 1970-01- 01 is another datatype: DATE. 123SELECT AVG(salary)From employeeWHERE sex = &quot;M&quot;; Another function we may use is AVG, which will return the mean of elements in the column selected. Here, we are finding the mean salary of male employees. 12SELECT SUM(salary)FROM employee; SUM function we give us the numerical sum of elements we selected from the database. Aggregation(聚合): GROUP BY is a powerful tool, we could put a column name afterwards and repeated elements in that column will be treated together as a group. 123SELECT COUNT(sex), sexFROM employeeGROUP BY sex; Here we want to find out the number of male and female employee respectively. GROUP BY is suitable here as it put all elements with sex =&quot;M&quot; together in a group and sex = &quot;F&quot; together in a different group. 123SELECT SUM(total_sales), emp_idFROM works_withGROUP BY emp_id; Similarly, we can find the sum of sales of each employee using GROUP BY Wildcard(通配符): % means any number of characters _ means one character. It is similar to regular expressions in other programming languages(正则表达式). In other words, wildcard means using % and _ to describe a general pattern to help us filter result. 123SELECT * FROM clientWHERE clien_name LIKE &quot;%LLC&quot; The example above has a new reserved word LIKE. A statement is followed by, which will describe a general pattern. Here ‘%LLC’ means there can be any number of words before &quot;LLC&quot; and the word needs to end up with &quot;LLC&quot;. If the statement is satisfied. The result will be returned, otherwise filtered.​ Another wildcard example: %Label%. This means the statement is satisfied as long as the VARCHAR contains a subsection &quot;Label&quot; Union: combine several SELECT results together(union columns together). This links two or multiple SELECT statements. 12345SELECT first_nameFROM employeeUNIONSELECT branch_nameFROM branch; Criteria: In order to successfully UNION multiple SELECT statements, each SELECT must have the same number of columns, otherwise there will be an error. We also need the datatype returned from each SELECT to be similar. If they are really different, there are likely to be an error as well. JOIN: combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns(foreign keys) 1234SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_nameFROM employeeJOIN branchON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id; The example above SELECT columns from different tables. FROM: reserved words(first table) JOIN: reserved words(second table) ON: reserved words, it tells MySQL, on what basis, rows should be joined together. In other words, if and only if employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id, should rows from different tables join together. There is a second type called LEFT JOIN: 1234SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_nameFROM employeeLEFT JOIN branchON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id; Every row in the FROM employee table will be shown. For the branch.branch_name, it will only join to the left table if ON condition is met, otherwise, its value will be NULL. There is also an opposite type of operation, which is RIGHT JOIN. It does exactly the opposite. Each row in the RIGHT JOIN table will be shown and rows in the FROM table will join only if ON condition is met, otherwise, it will be NULL Nested enquiry: We can use result from one query to filter data in another query. See the example below. It is like cascading the result of one enquiry into the other. 123SELECT works_with.emp_idFROM works_withWHERE works_with.total_sales &gt; 30000; Here, we find out employee id of employees whose salary exceeds 30k. What we can do is to put the statements above into another query as followed 1234567SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_nameFROM employeeWHERE employee.emp_id IN( SELECT works_with.emp_id FROM works_with WHERE works_with.total_sales &gt; 30000;); The part indented return a list ofemployee_id. WHERE filters ID that is not in the list so we only print out names of employees whose salary exceeds 30K. This is a useful method when handling data in different tables. In terms of the indent above, it is not necessary but makes readers easy to read. On Delete: how can we delete an element when it is associated with a foreign key. We already meet it before, remember when we set foreign key, we put an extra line which is ON DELETE SET NULL/ON DELETE CASCADE. That is what we are going to talk about now. ON DELETE SET NULL: means when we delete the primary key where the foreign key may lead to, this foreign key will automatically become NULL so there will be no error. ON DELETE CASCADE: will delete the entire row where the foreign key located instead of setting it to NULL. When the foreign key is also a primary key, we must use ON DELETE CASCADE because primary key can’t be NULL. Otherwise, we are free to choose between the two. EndThanks for reading.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[import numpy as np The data type in numpy is called array a = np.array([1,2,3]) to create a new array a=np.arange(1,12,3) from 1 to 11 with a step of 3 i.e. [1,4,7,10] Super useful in matplotlib The starting value will be included for sure while the ending value may not be included. a=np.linspace(1,13,5) create an array with 5 values and the step between them will be determined accordingly i.e.[1,4,7,10,13] Both, beginning and ending values will be included. a = a.reshape(3,2) change the dimension of an existing array. It means 3 rows and 2 columns here(2d array). ​ We may also create a multi-dimensional array manually using a = np.array([(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]) print(a.shape) will give us the shape of the array. print(a.size) will give us the length of the array kinda similar to len(list1) print(a.dtype) will give us the datatype of elements inside the array. print(a&gt;1) to test the size of the array. This will automatically compare all elements inside the array with 1 and return True or False for each element. a = a*3 will multiply every element in array by 3. Other Math operations can also be applied this way. a = np.zeros((3,4)) This creates a 3*4 array with zeros. Similarly, we have a = np.ones((1,10)) a = np.random.random((3,4)) create a 3*4 array with random decimal values under 1. a = np.random.randint(0,10,5) create an array with 5 elements random integers ranging from 0-10 print(a.sum()) will sum up all elements inside the array. print(a.sum(axis=1)) sum up elements in each row (This axis trick also works for min, max, mean and std below) print(a.sum(axis=0)) sum up elements in each column print(a.min()) will give the minimum element. print(a.max()) will give the maximum element. print(a.mean()) will give the mean of the array. print(a.std()) will give the standard deviation of the array. value = np.random.choice(a) will help you choose a random value from the array a. print(a.ndim) to find the dimension of the array. slicing of the array a = np.array([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)]) If we want 3 , print(a[0,2]) If we want 3 &amp; 6, use print(a[0:,2]) This is equivalent to print(a[0:2,2]) Putting two array together. We can do it in two directions vertically &amp; horizontally Vertically: 12345import numpy as npa = np.array([(1,2,3),(3,4,5)])b = np.array([(1,2,3),(3,4,5)])c = np.vstack((a,b))print(c) Horizontally: 12345import numpy as npa = np.array([(1,2,3),(3,4,5)])b = np.array([(1,2,3),(3,4,5)])c = np.hstack((a,b))print(c) change a multi-dimensional array to one dimension 1234import numpy as npa = np.array([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)])a = a.ravel()print(a) We get [1,2,3,4,5,6] print a sin function using both numpy and matplotlib: 123456import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltx = np.arange(0,3*np.pi,0.1)y = np.sin(x)plt.plot(x,y)plt.show()]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[\n will create a new line in a string. print(&quot;apple\npear&quot;) string.lower() will change every character in a string to lower cases. string.upper() will change every character in a string to upper cases. len(string) will return the length of the string. string[3] will could index a string(start from zero) string.index(A) will return the position where A first time appear in the string. If A is consisted of multiple characters, it will return the position of the first character in A. If A can’t be found in the string, you will get an error string.find(A) very similar to .index(A). The difference is that if we couldn’t find A in the string, it will return -1 instead of an error. string.replace(old,new,times) The old parameter inside the string will be replaced by the new parameter. Without specify times, all old substring will be replaced by new. We may only want to replace old substring certain number of times, simply fill in the times parameter. * means multiply in Python. ** means exponential. We can also use pow(A,B) which stands for A to the power of B. % will return the remainder of the division. 1// means division and round down the answer. Remainder: print(5//2) will return 2 while print(-5//2) will return -3. type(A) will return the data type of A. max(A,B,C) will return the greatest numerical value in A,B,C. min(A,B,C) does exactly the opposite. round(A) will help us rounding A. i.e. 5.4 becomes 5 and 4.7 becomes 5. list1[0] A list can be indexed. [-1] will return the last element in the list, [-2] will return the second last element etc. [1:] will give all elements include and after position 1. [1:3] will return elements at position 1 &amp; 2 but won’t include 3(左闭右开). list1[1] = new_value We can re-define an element value inside a list using this method. name = [&quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot; , &quot;Michael&quot;] number = [3,5,6,7] . If we want to combine these two lists, we could use name.append(number). This will return [&quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot; , &quot;Michael&quot;,[3,5,6,7]]. In other words, adding a list into a list. We can also do name.extend(number). This will return [&quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot; , &quot;Michael&quot;,3,5,6,7] 18 . Adding an element to a certain position in a list, we could use list1.insert(A,B). This means we want to put B(element) at position A. list1.remove(A) remove A(element) from the list. list1.pop() remove the last element from the list. list1.count(A) count how many times A(element) appears in a list. list1.sort() sort the list in default ascending order(numerical,alphabet). If we want to sort in descending order, use list1.sort(reverse = True). list1.reverse() This will reverse the order of the list. tuple1 = (A,B,C) use a small bracket to define. Its value can’t be changed once defined. We can have a list of tuples [(1,2),(3,4),(8,9)] if statement: the condition after if must be either True or False. Further Boolean algebra can be applied: or, and, nor etc. != means not equal in python dictionary1 = {key:value} In other words, key-value pairs are used to define a dictionary There are two ways of getting values in the dictionary. result=dictionary1[key]. This method will return an error if the key doesn’t exist. result=dictionary.get(key,default_value) If the key doesn’t exist, it will return None. We may also fill in a default value(optional) which will only be returned if the key doesn’t exist. While loop will keep running until the condition afterwards becomes False. Get out of one loop: break A string can be sliced. See the example. 12for i in “Love”: print(i) This will return “l”,”o”,”v”,”e” for i in range(3) means from 1 to 3 excluding 3. i.e. 1,2 We can put lists inside a list to make it a 2D(3D) array. 123list1 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] We can easily slicing the array bylist1[1][2]. This means obtaining the data at row 1 and column 2. We have 6 in this case. Nasty for means: cascading for loops. Here, we can have: 123456list1 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]for row in list1: for column in rows: pass Know what I mean, makes the logic really clear. A really beautiful example applying for loops, successfully solve the problem without cascading for loops. Problem: replace a(A), e(E), i(I), o(O), u(U) in a word by g(G). 1234567891011def translate(phrase): translation = "" for letter in phrase: if letter.lower() in "aeiou": if letter.isupper(): translation = translation + "G" else: translation = translation + "g" else: translation = translation + letter return translation Try&amp; except method 1234Try: In=int(input("Fill in the answer"))Except: Print("Invalid input, not an integer") Here, if the input isn’t an integer, an error will show up. By using try, except method, operations in except will run if and only if there is an error. We can also specify the type of error after expect, refer to the example below. 123456try: answer = 10 / int(input("Enter Number: "))except ZeroDivisionError as e: print(e)except: print("Caught any exception") If the input is zero, it will print out the error type in except because we only specified ZeroDivisionError. For any other types of errors, it will print out caught any exception. We can also specify other types of error such as ValueError etc. text = open(“filename.txt”, “mode”) Modes we have: “r”: read; “w”: overwrite existing file; “a”: append; “r+”: read &amp; overwrite, “a+”: read &amp; append; “b”: read the text in binary Make sure to close the file using text.close()once opened a file. To read all the content, using text.read() To read a certain line, use text.readline(). This will read the first line when we run it for the first time and read the second line when we run it for the second time etc. Also,we could use text.readlines(). This will put every line in a list, we could fetch any line using the index method. If we want to write(append) a file, make sure to change “r” into &quot;w&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) Using :text.write(“Whatever you want to add”) By creating a new class, we are actually creating a new datatype in some ways. When we use a class, we need to instantiate the class like oscar = Student(). oscar here is no longer a class instead it becomes an object. Inheritance: We can create a new class that contains all the functions and the attributes in the old class. Quick demo: class New(Old). I will write a separate note to introduce it in detail. If we want to change a float(decimal) to a fraction using the method below: 12from fractions import Fractionprint(str(Fraction(0.25))) ​ This will return &quot;1/4&quot; EndThanks for reading.

It will always return a Boolean value(True, False) print(1==True);print(0==False) These two statements will always return True. As in Python 1 also means True and 0 also means False. print(0==0.0) will also return True even though they are different data types. There is a special operation symbol which is in. For example, print(“a” in “abc”). This will return True. 3 types of logic order in Python: plain sequence(顺序), loop(循环) and branches(分支). while True will produce an infinite loop. break will terminate one layer of the loop. continue will only skip one element in a loop and don’t affect the remainder elements. range function can take 3 parameters. For example, range(1,10,2) This means a series from 1 to 9 with a step of 2. i.e.1,3,5,7,9 list1.pop(index) removes the element at the index position of the list. If we use list1.pop() and leave it black in brackets. It will drop the last element in the list. print(&quot;111&quot; in list1) If there is a 111 element in list1. It will return True, otherwise, it will return False. If we want to drop a list, use del list1. If we print(list1) afterwards, it will return an error. If we want to drop all elements in a list, use list1.clear(). If we print(list1) afterwards, it will return [] list1.index(element,start,end) passing in start and end, Python will search element within that range. If element isn’t in the range, an error will show up. We could use list1.find(element,start,end). If element is also not in that range, Python will return -1 rather than an error. There are two types of functions in Python. The first type .sort(), for example, it starts with a . It means that this function links to the data type before . The second type sorted(), for example, all these types of function are Python’s internal function, they do not related to the input data type. Enumerate() function： 123list1 = [“spring”,”summer”,”autumn”,”winter”]For index, content in enumerate(list1):print(index,content) This will return: 0 &quot;spring&quot; 1 &quot;summer&quot; 2 &quot;autumn&quot; 3 &quot;winter&quot; This function are fairly convenient when tackling algorithm questions. Create a list with ten 0 elements : list1 = [0]*10 This is unique to Python as well Create a 3*3 matrix filled with 0: 1234list1 = []for i in range 3: list1.append([0]*3) List comprehension(列表推导)： numerical: 12list1 = [1,2,3]print([i*3 for i in list1]) This will return [3,6,9] Logical: 12list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]print([i for i in list1 if i%2 == 0]) This will only print out even numbers so we get [2,4] as expected Mixing numerical and logical 12list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]print([i*2 for i in list1 if i%2 == 0]) This will return even numbers in the list and multiply their values by 2 so we got [4,8] as expected. Elements within dictionary have no order in Python. All keys need to be unique, if we have two values with the same key, the value which shows up later will overwrite the former. dictionary.keys() will collect all keys and return a list. dictionary.values() will collect all values and return a list. dictionary.items() This will collect both keys and values made up tuples in a list. We normally use it in the following format: 123dictionary = &#123;1:"one",2:"two",3:"three",4:"four"&#125;for i,j in dictionary.items(): print(i,j) This will return: 1, &quot;one&quot;, 2, &quot;two&quot;, 3, &quot;three&quot;, 4, &quot;four&quot; Drop an element from a dictionary: dictionary.pop(key) The value with the key in the bracket will be removed .append() has a low algorithm complexity while .insert() and .index() have high algorithm complexity List slicing: 12list1 = [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’, ‘ddd’, ‘eee’]print(list1[1:3]) This will give &quot;bbb&quot; &amp; &quot;ccc&quot; 12list1 = [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’, ‘ddd’, ‘eee’]print(list1[1:]) This will give &quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;, &quot;ddd&quot; &amp; &quot;eee&quot; 12list1 = [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’, ‘ddd’, ‘eee’]print(list1[:3]) This will give &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;bbb&quot; &amp; &quot;ccc&quot; 123list1 = [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’, ‘ddd’, ‘eee’]print(list1[:-1])print(list1[:4]) Results returned from the two print operations are the same which will both give &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot; &amp; &quot;ddd&quot; We may pass in three parameters when slicing. list1[start,end,step] A good and smart example: print(list1[::-1]) This operation will reverse the list and is equivalent to .reverse(). Let me quickly explain: The first : means starting from the end(right), -1 means moving to the left by one element every time. The second : means finishing at the end but won’t include the last element. 12list2 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]print(list2[0:len(list2):2] This will give all even numbers: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;8&quot; &amp; &quot;10&quot; When we input a negative step parameter, we must make sure the value of start parameter is greater than end parameter otherwise Python will return a []. Let’s say list2[-9:-6:-1], Python will take away 1 from -9 every time and try to achieve -6. Clearly, there is no way to get -6 by taking away 1s from -9 so we get []. In addition, Python don’t think list2[-1] is equivalent to list2[-12] :( set(集合): if we write {} in Python, by default, it will be treated as a dictionary. Elements in a set has no order, the order of the elements changed every time we print. Unless, all elements are int, they will be shown in descending order but we still can’t do index operation. set1.add() Add an extra element. set1.remove(element name) Remove an element by the element name. set1.pop() Remove the FIRST element from the set, we CANNOT pass in a index in the bracket. set operations： 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1-set2) This will give the difference set(差集). In other words, all elements within set1 but are not in set2. We get 1 here as expected. 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1|set2) This will give the union(合集). We get 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 here as expected. 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1^set2) This will give the complementary set(补集). We get 1 &amp; 4 here as expected. 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1&amp;set2) This will give the intersection set(交集). We get 2 &amp; 3 here as expected. 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1&lt;set2) If set1 is a subset(子集) of set2, we will get True , otherwise we will get False. we get False here as expected. 1234set1 = &#123;1,2,3&#125;set2 = &#123;2,3,4&#125;set3 = &#123;1,2,3,4&#125;print(set1&lt;set3) We get a True here as expected. Use set1.update(set2) to add all elements in set2 into set1. We could give variables in a function default values when defining:def fun(a=3,b): We can either pass in one variable or two variables when calling the function. Criteria: variables with default values must be placed in front of variables without default values. See the example below: 123def trial(a,b,c): print(f"&#123;a&#125;;&#123;b&#125;;&#123;c&#125;")trial(b=2,a=1,c=3) It is a good practice to passing in values of variables using this method as ORDER is not important in the above case. If we want to pass in multiple values for a parameter, we could add a * before the variable name. See the example below: 1234def trial(*args): for i in args: print(i)trial(1,2,"Oscar",[1,2,3]) It is equivalent to passing in a tuple(1,2,&quot;Oscar&quot;,[1,2,3]) to args. If we want the values we passed in for a parameter to be treated as a dictionary, we could add a ** before the variable name. See the example below: 12345def trial(**kwargs): for i,j in kwargs.items(): print(i) print(j)trial(name = "oscar", age = 19, gender = "M") This is equivalently to passing {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;oscar&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:19,&quot;gender&quot;:&quot;M&quot;} to kwargs. 12345def fun(): result = "Hello world" return resultprint(type(fun))print(type(fun())) For type(fun), Python will return &lt;class &#39;function&#39;&gt;. This is because we are printing out the type of the function and of course the answer will be function. In terms of type(fun()), we are calling the function and we are actually printing out the type of the returned value i.e. type of result variable. That’s why we get &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; Decorator(装饰器): add some codes to a function without changing the source code of the function. There multiple ways of achieving this. Define a new function and call the old function inside the new function 12345def greet_user(): print("Hello")def re_greet_user(): greet_user() print("world!") Define a new function and pass in the old function as a parameter 12345def greet_user(): print("Hello")def re_greet_user(func): func() print("world") We need to be crystal clear that we are passing in the old function as a parameter so there is no bracket. The function is called inside the new function. Define an inner function inside the new function so the user has a feeling we are still using greet_user which is the old function. 1234567891011121314def greet_user(): print("Hello") #define the old function def decorate_show(func): def inner(): func() print("world") #define the inner function that will print "Hello world" return inner #The decorate_show function will return the inner funciton. greet_user = decorate_show(greet_user) #call decorate_show#greet_user variable is now equal to the inner with old greet_user as func.greet_user() #Call the new greet_user If we need parameters for func(), make sure to pass it in at def inner(A,B):. This is basically the theory behind the decorator The final version, it is actually using the same theory as the third method but looks nicer. 123456789def decorate_show(func): def inner(): func() print("world") return inner@decorate_showdef great_user(): print("Hello") We simply put @decorate_function_name at the line above the function we wish to decorate. To make it easier to read, we can simply replace func() by great_user(). This is really significant as we haven’t touched the source code of the original function. Besides, we can add extra codes dynamically, no need to write everything at the start. If we want to ignore escape characters(转义字符), we can put r before the &quot; of a string. See the example: print(r”Hello\nworld”) These characters will be print out directly, no new line will be created. str1.lower() convert every character in a string to the lower case. str1.upper() convert every character in a string to the upper case. str1.title() convert the initial character of EVERY WORD in a string to the upper case. str1.capitalize() convert the initial character of the FIRST WORD in a string to the upper case. print(str1.center(20, “*”)) This means put str1 in the middle. If its length is shorter than 20 characters, * will be used to fill the remainder. Similarly, we have str1.ljust(20, “*”) and str1.rjust(20, “*”). The difference is where str1 will be placed(left, right or middle) in the new string. str1.count(sub,start,end) give how many times sub appears in str1 within the start, end range. By leave start and end parameters away, Python will search the whole string. str1.index(sub,start,end) search from the left and return the position where sub first time appears within the start, end range. If sub isn’t found, an error will appear. str1.rindex(object,start,end) Do the very similar but start searching from the right. str1.endswith(“xxx”) return True if str1 ends with “xxx”, otherwise False. str1.startswith(“xxx”) return True if str1 starts with “xxx”, otherwise False. str1.isalpha() return True if every character in str1 in a letter, otherwise False. It is a powerful tool for filtration when using with the for loop. See the example below. 1234str1 = "a1b2c3d4"for i in str1: if i.isalpha() == True: print(i, end = "") Similarly, we have str1.isdigit(). It will return True, if every character in str1 in a number, otherwise False. str1.isspace() return True if every character in str1 is a space, otherwise False. May also be used for filtration. str1.strip() If str1 starts with a space, that space will be removed. str1.lstrip() If str1 ends up with a space, that space will be removed. str1.replace(old,new,times) If the old string appears in str1, it will be replaced by new. By default, this operation will keep going until no old string is in str1 any more. We may limit the times this operation is called, by passing in a times parameter. str1.split(&quot;a&quot;) str1 will be separated into two pieces every time there is &quot;a&quot;. See the example, 12str1 = "bbbacccadddaeee"print(str1.split("a")) This will return [bbb,ccc,ddd,eee] str1.splitlines() str1 will be separated into two pieces every time there is &quot;\n&quot;. list1.join() Every element inside list1 will be attached together and make up a string If we have a list of values and we want to find its mean, we can use the statistics package. 12from statistics import meanprint(mean([1,2,5,7,9,8])) We can also find median(中位数), mode(众数) and variance(方差) exact the same way just by replacing mean in the statements above. If another file2.py file is in the same folder as the file1.py we are currently running. We can use import file2 to import it directly. If not we can use either the absolute address or the relative address. print(dir(variable_name)) We can print out all functions that may be applied to this variable(data type) If we do print(dir(package_name)), we can print out all functions that are inside that package. pip list show all packages that we have installed pip install install a package ​ pip uninstall uninstall a package print(os.getcwd()) give the absolute address of the file we are currently running. os.makedirs(“folder name”) Create a new folder, will return an error if already exists. os.removedirs(“Folder name”) Remove an empty folder, will report an error if there is any content inside. print(os.listdir()) Print all documents in the current folder. os.remove(“filename”) Remove a file os.chdir(“address”) It is just like the cd operation in the cmd os.curdir() return to the folder where current .py file is located. If we .read(), .readlines() or .readline() a file in a+ and w+ mode, nothing will be returned. This is because w+ will clear the file by default before the read operation. a+ will move the cursor to the end of the text to get ready for the appending operation. A way to fix it is by using file.seek(0,0) to move the cursor back to the start of the file. Another method to open a file so we don’t need to close it 12with open(“filename”, “r”, encoding = ) as file: content = file.read() Combining two list1 into a dictionary: dict(zip(list_keys,list_values))]]></content>
